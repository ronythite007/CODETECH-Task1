# Overview Of Project 
# Project : PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. The goal is to predict the dependent variable based on the independent variable, understand the relationship between them, and evaluate the model's performance.

# Objective
Objective: To build and evaluate a simple linear regression model that predicts a continuous target variable based on an independent variable.
# Key Activities
## Data Preparation:
 • Load the dataset.
 • Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Training:
 • Train the linear regression model on the training dataset.

## Model Evaluation:
 • Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
 • Make predictions on the test set.

## Visualization:
 • Plot the regression line to visualize the relationship between the predictor and target variables.
 • Create a scatter plot to compare actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

# Technology Used

## Programming Language: Python
## Libraries:
 • pandas for data manipulation and analysis
 • numpy for numerical computations
 • scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
 • matplotlib for data visualization

# Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive example of how to implement, evaluate, and visualize a simple linear regression model using Python. The evaluation metrics and visualizations help in understanding the model's performance and the relationship between the variables. This serves as a foundation for more advanced regression techniques and can be extended to include multiple predictors, regularization, and other improvements.
